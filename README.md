# OMLib
OMlib is a pythonic  library to work with the Ontology of Units of Measure. 

It provides classes and functions to define measures and points on a scale using units and measuring scales. Converting between units such as between metres and yards or more complex units as kilogram per metre squared and pound per light year squared are easily done. This includes, of course, conversion between different measurement scales, such as between the Celsius and Reamur scales.
